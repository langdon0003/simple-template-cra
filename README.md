### Simple Template React to kickstart in 01s inspired by Glitch
===========================

This app is a very small scaffold to get you started using the default Create React App.

Your Project
------------

- edit files in `src` folder, it contains all the React stuff
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
